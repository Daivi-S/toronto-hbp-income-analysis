, 2021 Census of Population - Socio-Demographic Variables (Population - Visible Minority) - City of Toronto Neighbourhoods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  The data sets used to calculate population denominators were derived from Statistics Canada's 2021 Census of Population (Census), Catalogue #98-401-X2021006-3 Ontario, released October 26, 2022. The Census catalogue contains population counts by Dissemination Area (DA) and by Census Subdivision (CSD).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  The sum of component statistics (e.g. ""South Asian"" + ""Latan American"") within each tabulated category may not equal to the component total within the row or to the column total at the bottom of the table (e.g. City of Toronto) due to data suppression (see note below) or rounding procedures used by Statistics Canada at the Dissemination Area level and the subsequent aggregation of many DAs into larger geographic areas. Where a combined count is required, we recommend that users apply the value(s) from the column(s) with the combined total(s) instead of summing smaller data groupings such as variable subcategories. Note: Some sub-categories tabulated by Statistics Canada may be excluded from this table. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  City of Toronto counts are from Census Subdivision totals reported in the Census catalogue. Neighbourhood geographies may include one or more Dissemination Area(s) where Statistics Canada has suppressed DA-level data for reasons of confidentiality, data quality or incomplete enumeration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  Refer to Statistics Canada's website or meta-data file for additional definitions and explanations. Names of Census variables in column headings or sheet titles are taken from the Statistics Canada Census 2021 catalogue. For information about OCHPP definitions, data quality & limitations, and selection and preparation of variables, visit our ""About the Data"" page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  ^ Total Population refers to Total - Visible minority for the population in private households, as defined by Statistics Canada for this group of variables. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  # Data entered under columns labelled ""Arab"" and ""Latin American"" were transposed in the February 15, 2023, version of this file. Data reported in this tab, revised September 26, 2023, correct that error.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  * Indicates value is between 6 and 29. Any calculations using this value as a denominator, or any combination of variables that sum to a value between 6 and 29, should be reported with caution. If used in the numerator, values between 6 and 19, or any combination of variables that sum to a value between 6 and 19, should be reported with caution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
