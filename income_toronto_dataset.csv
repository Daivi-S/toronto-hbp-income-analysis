, 2021 Census of Population - Socio-Demographic Variables (Income for Persons in Low-Income Categories) - City of Toronto Neighbourhoods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The data sets used to calculate these statistics were derived from Statistics Canada's 2021 Census of Population (Census), Catalogue #98-401-X2021006-3 Ontario, released October 26, 2022. The Census catalogue contains low-income statistics by Dissemination Area (DA) and by Census Subdivision (CSD).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The sum of component statistics (e.g. ""in LICO-AT (0-17 yrs)"" + ""in LICO-AT (18-64 yrs)"") within each tabulated category may not equal to the component total within the row or to the column total at the bottom of the table (e.g. City of Toronto) due to data suppression (see note below) or rounding procedures used by Statistics Canada at the Dissemination Area level and the subsequent aggregation of many DAs into larger geographic areas. Where a combined count is required, we recommend that users apply the value(s) 
  from the column(s) with the combined total(s) instead of summing smaller data groupings such as variable subcategories. Note: Some sub-categories tabulated by Statistics Canada may be excluded from this table. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" City of Toronto counts are from Census Subdivision totals reported in the Census catalogue. Neighbourhood geographies may include one or more Dissemination Area(s) where Statistics Canada has suppressed DA-level data for reasons of confidentiality, data quality or incomplete enumeration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" LICO-AT: Low-Income Cut-Off - After Tax; LIM-AT: Low-Income Measure - After Tax. Refer to Statistics Canada's website or meta-data file for additional definitions and explanations. Names of Census variables in column headings or sheet titles are taken from the Statistics Canada Census 2021 catalogue. For information about OCHPP definitions, data quality & limitations, and selection and preparation of variables, visit our ""About the Data"" page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ^ The percent of population in low-income reported in this table is a total population measure, inclusive of all age groups for income reported in the 2020 calendar year. Columns marked with an ^ are the denominators used for this table. The persons to which low-income concepts apply was determined by Statistics Canada. Low-income ratios within each age group can be re-calculated using the count of total population specific to the age group; these totals are reported at the left-hand-side at the start of each age group. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  Any calculations using values between 5 and 29 as a denominator, or any combination of variables that sum to a value between 5 and 29, should be reported with caution. If used in the numerator, values between 5 and 19, or any combination of variables that sum to a value between 5 and 19, should be reported with caution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Statistics Canada randomly rounds all reported data to multiples of '5' or '10' to protect against disclosure of identifiable individuals. This practice is applied independently to all totals (e.g. Province or Census Subdivision totals) and subtotals (e.g. Dissemination Areas). Refer to the OCHPP ""About the Data"" documents for more information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
